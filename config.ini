# 1 = Show test results summary after testing complete
# 2 = Also show module progress
# 3 = Also show failed tests
# 4 = Also show ignored tests
# 5 = Also show passed tests (shows all tests)
# 6 = Group all tests by test group
# 7 = Show all groups by source file

# cmod generate --config=new_config.ini

# File definitions can have either a name_callback,
# or at least (a prefix or suffix or both), but not both prefix/suffix and a
